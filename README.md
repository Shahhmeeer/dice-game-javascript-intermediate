## Introduction
### Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to teach and reinforce intermediate JavaScript concepts through practical application. By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience in the following areas:

1. Changing the Source of an Image Tag with JavaScript: Learn how to dynamically update the images displayed on a web page using JavaScript. This involves manipulating the src attribute of HTML <img> elements.

2. Changing Text Content through JavaScript: Discover how to modify text content on a web page using JavaScript. This includes updating the text displayed within HTML elements such as paragraphs (<p>).

3. Working with JavaScript Arrays: Develop proficiency in working with JavaScript arrays, a fundamental data structure. You will use arrays to manage game data, track scores, and perform other essential tasks within the game.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the "Dice Game JavaScript Intermediate" project:

1. Clone or Download the Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
` git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-game-javascript-intermediate.git `

2. Open the Project in Your Code Editor: Open the project directory in your preferred code editor. You can explore the existing code and files to understand how the game is structured.

3. Run the Game: Open the index.html file in your web browser. Interact with the game and observe how changes in the JavaScript code affect the gameplay and user experience.

## Project Structure
The project structure consists of the following files and directories:

- index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- main.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.
- images/: A directory containing dice images (dice1.png through dice6.png) used in the game.

## How to Play
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

2. You will see two dice images representing two players.

3. Click the "Refresh Me" button to roll the dice.

4. The images will update to show the dice faces rolled by each player, and the game will display the winner or declare a draw based on the rolls.

5. Keep clicking the button to play again and observe how the game updates dynamically.

## Key JavaScript Concepts
